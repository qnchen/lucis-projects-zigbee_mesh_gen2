Z-Stack Mesh Release Notes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0.0
September 22, 2014


Notices:
 - The Z-Stack Mesh 1.0.0 release is based on the certified Z-Stack Core 2.6.2
   See the "Z-Stack Core Release Notes" for details. 

 - Z-Stack Mesh provides over 20 documents that cover various aspects of this
   generic wireless Mesh development package. Included is API documentation for
   each layer of the Z-Stack system, a selection of Developer's Guides, User's
   Guides, and Application Notes to accelerate your product development. These
   documents can be found at: <InstallPath>\Documents with the default set to:
   "C:\Texas Instruments\Z-Stack Mesh 1.0.0\Documents" which can be accessed
   from the Windows Start Menu.

 - Z-Stack for the CC2530 and CC2520 devices has been built and tested with
   IAR's CLIB library, which provides a light-weight C library which does not
   support Embedded C++. Use of DLIB is not recommended for those platforms.
   Z-Stack for the CC2538 platform has been tested with the DLIB library.

 - Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements
   in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler
   Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EW8051 or EW430 compilers,
   settings made in the IDE will override settings in the *.cfg files. When
   using the EWARM compiler, settings in the *.cfg files will override any
   made in the IDE.

 - When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire
   Flash memory should be erased. For the CC2530 and CC2520 devices, select
   "Erase Flash" in the "Debugger->Texas Instruments->Download" tab of the
   project options. For the CC2538, select "Project->Download->Erase Memory".

 - The library files have been built and tested with the following versions
   of IAR tools and may not work with different versions of the IAR tools:
     - CC2538 + SRF06EB:  EWARM 7.20.1  (7.20.1.7307)
     - CC2530 + SRF05EB:  EW8051 8.30.3 (8.30.3.41795)
     - CC2530 + EXP5438:  EW430 6.10.2  (6.10.2.50871)

 - Foundation software library files for the CC2538 include the following:
     - bsp.lib, version 1.3.1
     - driverlib.lib, version 1.3.1
     - usblib.lib, version 1.0.1


Changes:
 - [5806] The GenericApp sample application has been upgraded provide better
   user feedback. The LCD display now shows the number of messages received,
   an LED flashes each time a message is received, and the user can easily
   change the interval between message transmissions.

 - [5804] The "Z-Stack Generic Application User's Guide" has been created to
   provide a step-by-step tutorial on building the application, loading it on
   a Texas Instruments development board, and running it to demonstrate basic
   features of a Z-Stack wireless mesh network application.

 - [5666] Changed compiler optimization settings for CC2538-based IAR projects
   from "None" to "High, Balanced". This affects GenericApp and ZNP projects.


Memory Sizes:
 - Actual usage of Flash and RAM memory is variable, of course, and dependent
   on the specific application. Developers should adjust various parameters,
   such as, program stack size and dynamic memory heap size to meet their
   specific needs.

 - The following tables provide comparison of Flash and RAM sizes for certain
   device configurations for the GenericApp applications that are provided with
   this release. GenericApp projects for various platforms can be found in the
   installed <InstallPath>\Projects\zstack\Samples\GenericApp folder. In most
   Z-Stack sample applications, generic heap and stack settings are used which
   have been selected to accomodate a wide range of applications. GenericApp
   heap settings were: Coordinator/Router = 3Kb, EndDevice = 2Kb. Refer to the
   "Z-Stack Developer's Guide" for details on profiling heap memory usage.

 - Memory sizes (Flash/RAM) are shown below for the 3 ZigBee device types on
   various MCU and RF platforms with ZigBee-PRO enabled and Security enabled.
   See the "Z-Stack User's Guide" for more details on the platform of interest.

Known Issues:
 - To disable security at build time, use the "SECURE=0" compile option. Do
   not attempt to disable security by setting the SECURITY_LEVEL to zero.

 - The ZDO Complex Descriptor is not supported.
